This is the montepython likelihood for the CamSpec PR4_12.6cl likelihood, described in [Rosenberg, Gratton, and Efstathiou (2022), MNRAS, 517, 4620](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/517/3/4620/6717656) ([arxiv:2205.10869](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10869)).
This is a high-ell likelihood using dust-cleaned TT, TE, and EE power spectra computed from the Planck 2020 (PR4 / NPIPE) maps.
Produced by George Efstathiou, Steven Gratton and Erik Rosenberg.
Python likelihood code by Antony Lewis based on Fortran code by Efstathiou, Gratton, and Lewis. Ported to montepython by Erik Rosenberg.
